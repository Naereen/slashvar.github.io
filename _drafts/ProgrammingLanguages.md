Title: Programming Languages
---

Programming languages is a vast topic, the kind of topic that can get you into
never ending troll and flame war. Anyway, as programmers, we like discussions
about programming languages, we like to discover new one, we like to hear what
are others arguments ... So, I will take the step and open the subject (I'm
        taking no risk here, I don't have comments on my blog !)

I'll start with general comments about languages, rather than going on languages
one by one, but don't afraid, I'll probably have some rant and opionnated
components on your beloved language too !

## Syntax

Syntax is the first aspect of a language you see, it drivres a lot of discussion
because most issues about syntax are a matter of taste, but there's a lot things
we talk about.

In my opion, syntax must satisfy two obvious main qualities, in that precise
order:

* it must be easy to write
* it must be easy to read

Let me go a little deeper on that.

### Easy to write

Programming is a hard task, it requires a lot of attention and you don't want
to waste your brain time on syntax. Over the years, I've started to identify
some key points that make language syntax easier to write.

* Keep common used elements short: the things you're typing often need to be
  quick to type !
* Less used elements should have explicit representation, probably a keyword.
* Avoid complex keywords or complex multi-symbols elements: just think about how
  many typos you can have in a word like `exception` or can you quickly type
  `%:%:` ?
* Have a strong unambiguous structure: this one is tricky, but if you need to
  struggle with you code structure, you'll loose a lot of time !

As usual, those points really depend on personnal taste. On my side, I prefer
symbols over keywords and language with explicit structure delimiters.

In order to be a little bit more precise, here are some personnal comments on
various language (syntax only):

* **pascal**: this is for me the example not to follow on syntax, far too much
keywords.

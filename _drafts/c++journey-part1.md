Title: A C++ journey - part 1
---

I decided to start a new serie about C++, my goal is not to begin a new
tutorial, not to present ground breaking C++ tricks. No, just the way I see the
language, what I found interesting and useful, what I found annoying, badly
design or missing.

Since it's the first post in the serie, I'll start with a quick introduction,
not on C++, but on why C++. And then, I'll attack what I found the most
important aspect of the language: scope, value semantic and RAII.

## Why you should love C++

## Values, values everywhere

## OOP or not OOP
